# timetable
Timetable app to parse FAST-NU KHI's CS timetable & send users their classes schedule in emails; there also used to be an Android app where we showed the timetable to users. More details on what it does: https://qr.ae/pv9SCE

NOTE: This repository is the best example of how you should NOT build something, and it does not reflect my current skills, I started this project during my freshman year when I did not know anything about the best practices -- if it works then it works. You can find a lot of API keys and secrets, but they are not valid anymore so don't even bother.

ANOTHER NOTE: It did the job back then, it simplified my life and a lot of my university mates were happy with it so who cares what was powering the app :D
